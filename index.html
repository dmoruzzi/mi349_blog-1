        <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my new blog and I would like to start off with this quick overview of my quick test drive of a Tesla Model 3 from earlier this year. To be clear, this test drive took place in February before the COVID-19 outbreak expanded here in the United States. Since I am from the Detroit metro area, I went to Tesla’s website to schedule a test drive at a Tesla gallery located in a nearby upscale mall. The process was very simple and then I was looking forward to trying out a pure electric car for the first time. On the day of the test drive, I went to the Tesla gallery and checked in with a representative. After waiting for a bit, a specialist showed up with the “key” card for a Model 3. Then we went out to the parking garage where Tesla kept their test drive vehicles. I ended up driving the gray Model 3 Long Range dual motor all-wheel drive variant shown in the photo above. This specific vehicle was equipped with the optional 19-inch wheels and the “full self-driving” package that included features such as “navigate on autopilot”, “smart summon”, and more. After the specialist showed me how to adjust the seat, steering wheel, and mirrors, I had about 30 minutes to drive the vehicle around. The first thing I noticed was how the car was so quiet due to the absence of an internal combustion engine. Also </p>
