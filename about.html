    <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Tan and I am currently a fourth-year 
        senior at Michigan State University with a major in Computer Science 
        and a minor in Information Technology. This is my blog that will mostly revolve around
        topics such as cars, travel, and technology. Ever since I have been young, I have always had an interest in anything relate to cars, travel, and tech. My goal with this blog is that people can learn from my experiences and possibly gain knowledge to apply to any of their personal interests. I hope everyone will enjoy reading about my 
        experiences and discussions and thank you for visiting my blog.
